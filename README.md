# Java: Data Structures and Algorithms
All algorithms and data structures are implemented in Java

This repository is a collection of algorithms and data structures I have implemented in my academic (and professional) life. The code is not optimized and some of the implementations are still incorrect and I am currently in the process of correcting and improving them.

The algorithms and data structures will be tested in the future.
